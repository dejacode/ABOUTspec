    <h2>
      Purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
      An ABOUT file provides a simple way to document the provenance (origin and
      license) and other important or interesting information about a software component.
      An ABOUT file is a small text file stored in the codebase side-by-side
      with the software component file or archive that it documents.
      No modification of the documented software is needed.
      </p>
      <p>The ABOUT format is plain text with field name/value pairs separated by a colon.
      It is easy to read and create by hand and is designed first for humans,
      rather than machines. The format is well-defined and structured just
      enough to make it easy to process with software as well.
      It contains enough information to fulfill key license requirements such
      as creating credits or attribution notices, collecting redistributable
      source code or an inventory of components.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Getting Started
    </h2>
    <p>
      A simple and valid ABOUT file named httpd.ABOUT may look like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      about_resource: httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz
      name: Apache HTTP Server
      version: 2.4.3

      home_url: http://httpd.apache.org

      download_url: http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz

      license: apache-2.0
      license_file: httpd.LICENSE
      notice_file: NOTICE
      copyright: Copyright (c) 2012 The Apache Software Foundation.
    </pre>
    <p>
      The meaning of this ABOUT file is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      The file &quot;httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz&quot; is stored in the same directory and side-by-side with the ABOUT file &quot;httpd.ABOUT&quot; that documents it.
      </li>
      <li>
      The name of this component is &quot;Apache HTTP Server&quot; with version &quot;2.4.3&quot;.
      </li>
      <li>
      The home URL for this component is
          <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">
          http://httpd.apache.org
          </a>
      </li>
      <li>
      The file &quot;httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz&quot; was originally downloaded from
      <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz">
        http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz
      </a>
      </li>
      <li>
      In the same directory, &quot;httpd.LICENSE&quot; and &quot;NOTICE&quot; are files that contain respectively the license text
      and the notice text for this component.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Specification
    </h2>
    <p>
      An ABOUT file is a text file with lines of colon-separated &quot;field name&quot;:&quot;value&quot; pairs.
      This format is loosely based on the Email header field format as specified in RFC5322/RFC822 at
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322">
        http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322
      </a>.
      The text must be encoded as UTF-8.
      By reusing this specification, several available tools and libraries can parse and interpret ABOUT files.
      Note that while Unicode characters are not supported in an ABOUT file proper, external files can contain UTF-8 Unicode.
    </p>

    <h3>
      ABOUT file name
    </h3>
    <p>
    An ABOUT file name can use a limited set of characters and is suffixed
    with a &quot;.ABOUT&quot; extension using any combination of uppercase and lowercase characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A file name can contain only these US-ASCII characters:
      <li> digits from 0 to 9 </li>
      <li> uppercase and lowercase letters from A to Z</li>
      <li> the &quot;_&quot; underscore, &quot;-&quot; dash and &quot;.&quot; period signs. </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of a file name is not significant.
      On case-sensitive file systems (such as on Linux), a tool must report an
      error if two ABOUT files stored in the same directory have the same lowercase file name.
      This is to ensure that ABOUT files can be used across different file systems and operating systems.
      The convention is to use a lowercase file name and an uppercase ABOUT extension.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Lines of text
    </h3>
    <p>
      An ABOUT file contains lines of UTF-8 text.
      Lines contain field names/values pairs.
      The standard line ending is the LF character.
      The line ending characters can be any LF, CR or CR/LF and tools must
      normalize line endings to LF when processing an ABOUT file.
      Empty lines and lines containing only white spaces that are not part of a
      field value continuation are ignored.
      Empty lines are commonly used to improve the readability of an ABOUT file.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Field name
    </h3>
    <p>
      A field name can contain only these US-ASCII characters:
      <li> digits from 0 to 9 </li>
      <li> uppercase and lowercase letters from A to Z</li>
      <li> the &quot;_&quot; underscore sign. </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      Field names are not case sensitive. For example, &quot;HOME_URL&quot;
      and &quot;Home_url&quot; represent the same field name.
    </p>

    <p>
      A field name must start at the beginning of a new line.
      It can be followed by one or more spaces that must be ignored.
      These spaces are commonly used to improve the readability of an ABOUT file.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Field value
    </h3>
    <p>
      The field value is separated from the field name by a &quot;:&quot; colon.
      The &quot;:&quot; colon can be followed by one or more spaces that must be ignored.
      This also applies to trailing white spaces: they are ignored.

    </p>
    <p>
      A field value is composed of one or more lines of text.
      When a field value contains more than one line of text,
      additional continuation lines must start with at least one space.
      In this case, the first space of a continuation line is
      ignored and should be removed from the field value by tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a field contains multiple lines of text, it may be specified here
      either as a single value (for instance a description spanning multiple lines)
      or as a list of values (for instance multiple license files)
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example the value of the description field spans multiple lines:
    </p>
    <pre>
description: This is a long description for a
 software component that spans multiple lines with arbitrary line breaks.
     </pre>


    <h3>
      Fields are mandatory or optional
    </h3>
    <p>
      As defined in this specification, a field can be mandatory.
      Tools must report an error for missing mandatory fields.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Custom fields
    </h3>
    <p>
      A custom field is a field with a name not defined in this specification.
      Custom fields must be collected and supported by tools. 
      Their meaning is not specified.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Fields validation
    </h3>
    <p>
      When processing an ABOUT file, tools must report a warning or error if
      a field is invalid.
      A field can be invalid for several reasons, such as invalid field name
      syntax or invalid content.

      Tools should report additional validation error details.

      The validation process should check that field names are
      syntactically correct and that field values are correct values according to
      this specification.
      For certain fields, additional and specific validations are relevant such as
      checksum verification, URL validation, path resolution and verification, and so forth.
      Tools should report a warning for custom fields.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Fields order and precedence
    </h3>
    <p>
      The field order does not matter with the following exception:
      multiple occurrences of a field name are possible and must be interpreted
      such that only the last occurrence is considered as the value for this
      field. Previous occurrences of the same field name must be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tool processing an ABOUT file must issue a warning when a field name
      occurs more than once in an ABOUT file.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Field referencing files
    </h3>
    <p>
      The value of some fields may be contained in another file such as a license text.
      In this case the field name is suffixed with &quot;_file&quot; and the
      field value must be a path pointing to the file that contains the actual value of the field.
      This path must be a POSIX path relative to the path of the ABOUT file.
      The file content must be UTF-8-encoded text.
      To reference multiple files, set each file path on a new continuation line.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the license text is often stored in a file named COPYING:
    </p>
    <pre>
      license_file: COPYING
    </pre>

    <p>
      In this example, the license file is stored in a doc directory,
      one directory above the ABOUT file directory, using a relative path:
    </p>
    <pre>
      license_file: ../docs/ruby.LICENSE
    </pre>


    <h3>
      Field referencing URLs
    </h3>
    <p>
      The value of a field may reference URLs such as a homepage or a download.
      In this case the field name is suffixed with &quot;_url&quot; and the
      field value must be a valid absolute URL.
      To reference multiple URLs, set each URLs on a new continuation line.
      For example, a download URL is referenced this way:
    </p>
    <pre>
      download_url: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.4.20.tar.bz2
    </pre>

    <h3>
      Flag fields
    </h3>
    <p>
      Flag fields have a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; value.
      True, T, 1, Yes or Y must be interpreted as &quot;true&quot; in any case combination.
      False, F, 0, No or N must be interpreted as &quot;false&quot; in any case combination.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Mandatory fields
    </h3>
    <p>
      A tool processing an ABOUT file must report an error if a mandatory field is missing.
      Mandatory fields include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      about_resource: Used to reference the resources (files or directories) documented by an ABOUT file.
      </li>
      <li>
      name: The name of the documented Component.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
    Referencing the resources (files or directories) documented by an ABOUT file. 
    </h3>
    <p>
      The about_resource field is used to reference one or more files or directories documented in an ABOUT file. 
      This field contains one value per line. Each value is a name or path relative to the location of the ABOUT file.
      Paths must use POSIX paths &quot;/&quot; forward slash as path separators.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a file named django.ABOUT contains the following field to document the
      django-1.2.3.tar.gz archive stored in the same directory:
    </p>
    <pre>
      about_resource: django-1.2.3.tar.gz
    </pre>

    <p>
      In this example, the ABOUT file documents a whole sub-directory and a single file:
    </p>
    <pre>
      about_resource: downloads/linux-kernel-2.6.23/
       include/linux/kernel.h
    </pre>

    <p>
      Use a &quot;.&quot; period to reference the current whole directory:
    </p>
    <pre>
      about_resource: .
    </pre>

    <p>
      All paths are interpreted relative to the ABOUT file location 
      therefore, / also references the current directory:
    </p>
    <pre>
      about_resource: /
    </pre>


    <h3>
      Origin fields
    </h3>
    <ul>
     <li>
      version: Component version. A component usually has a version, such as a revision number or
      hash from a version control system (for a snapshot checked out from VCS such as Subversion or Git). If not
      available, the version should be the date the component was provisioned, in an ISO date format such as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
     </li>

    <h3>
      Documenting files stored in a version control system (VCS)
    </h3>
    <p>
      These fields provide a simple way to reference files stored in a version control system.
      There are many VCS tools such as Git, Mercurial, Subversion, CVS, etc.
      Accurate addressing of a file or directory revision in each tool in a uniform way may not be possible.
      Some tools may require access control via user/password or certificate and this information should not be stored in an ABOUT file.
      This extension defines the &quot;vcs_&quot; field extension prefix and a few common fields to handle the
      diversity of ways that VCS tools reference files and directories under version control:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      vcs_tool: VCS tool such as git, svn, cvs, etc.
     </li>

     <li>
      vcs_repository: A repository URL or identifier to point to a repository such as an SVN or Git repository URL.
     </li>

     <li>
      vcs_revision: Revision identifier such as a revision hash or version number.
     </li>

     <li>
      vcs_path: Path used by the VCS tool to point to a file, directory or module inside a repository.
     </li>

     <li>
      vcs_tag: Version tag used by the VCS tool.
     </li>

     <li>
      vcs_branch: Branch name used by the VCS tool.
     </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      Some examples for using the vcs_* extension fields include:
    </p>
    <pre>
      vcs_tool: git
      vcs_repository: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
      vcs_path: tools/lib/traceevent
      vcs_revision: b59958d90b3e75a3b66cd311661535f94f5be4d1
    </pre>
    <p>
      or
    </p>
    <pre>
      vcs_tool: svn
      vcs_repository: http://svn.code.sf.net/p/inkscape/code/inkscape_project/
      vcs_path: trunk/inkscape_planet/
      vcs_revision: 22886
    </pre>


    <h3>
      Checksums and digital signatures
    </h3>
    <p>
      These fields support checksums (such as SHA1 and MD5) and signatures (such as GPG) used to verify file integrity.  
      A tool can optionally use these to verify the integrity of a file documented
      by an ABOUT file.
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>
      checksum:
      Checksum for the file(s) documented by this ABOUT file in the &quot;about_resource&quot; field. One line per value.
      The value prefix defines the checksum algorithm such as &quot;md5:&quot;, &quot;sha1:&quot;, &quot;sha256:&quot;. The
      checksum algorithms and formats are as defined in the GNU Coreutils tools md5sum, sha1sum and sha256sum commands (
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">
        http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/
      </a>) that follow the specifications defined in the FIPS-180-2 standard (
      <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf">
        http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf
      </a>). 
     <li>
      signature_file: Sgnature file for the file(s) documented by this ABOUT file in the &quot;about_resource&quot; field.
      Signature files for GPG and PGP are commonly provided to verify code archives integrity and provenance such as here:
      <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.1.7.tar.sign">
        http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.1.7.tar.sign
      </a> or here:

       </a>
     </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some examples:
    </p>
    <pre>
      signature_file: signature/linux-3.1.7.tar.sign
      checksum: md5:f30b9c173b1f19cf42ffa44f78e4b96c
