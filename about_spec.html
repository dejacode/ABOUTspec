    <h2>
      Purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of an ABOUT file is to provide a minimalist and simple way to document the provenance (origin and
      license) and other important or interesting information about a software component. An ABOUT file is a small text
      file stored in the codebase side-by-side with the software component it documents. No modification of the
      documented software is needed. The format is plain text with name/value pairs separated by a colon and simple
      conventions. It is easy to read and create by hand and is designed first for humans, not for machines. The format
      is well-defined and structured just enough to make it easy to process with software too. It contains enough
      information to fulfill key license requirements such as creating credits or attribution notices and collect
      redistributable source code or get informed about new versions of a software component.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Getting Started
    </h2>
    <p>
      A simple and valid ABOUT file named httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz.ABOUT may look like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      name: Apache HTTP Server
      home_url: http://httpd.apache.org
      download_url: http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz
      version: 2.4.3
      date: 2012-08-21
      license_spdx: Apache-2.0
      license_text_file: httpd.LICENSE
      copyright: Copyright 2012 The Apache Software Foundation.
      notice_file: httpd.NOTICE
    </pre>
    <p>
      The meaning of this file is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This ABOUT file documents the file httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz, because the ABOUT file name is
      httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz.ABOUT. The file httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz.ABOUT is stored in the same folder as the documented file 
      httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz. 
      </li>
      <li>
      The name of this component is &quot;Apache HTTP Server&quot; and it's version is &quot;2.4.3&quot;.
      </li>
      <li>
      The home URL for this component is &quot;http://httpd.apache.org&quot;.
      </li>
      <li>
      The file httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz was originally downloaded from 
      <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz">
        http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz
      </a>
      </li>
      <li>
      In the same folder, there is a file named httpd.LICENSE that contains the license text for this component.
      and a file named httpd.NOTICE that contains the notice text for this component.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Specification
    </h2>
    <p>
      The format of an ABOUT file format is simple: lines of colon-separated name:values pairs. It is loosely based
      on the Email header field format as specified in RFC5322 at
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322">
        http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322
      </a>. This provides a convenient and well-defined specification and there are many available tools and
      libraries that can parse and interpret this format. An ABOUT file content is encoded as UTF-8.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Field names syntax
    </h3>
    <p>
      Field names can contain only these US-ASCII characters: digits from 0 to 9, uppercase and lowercase letters from A
      to Z and the &quot;_&quot; underscore sign. The formal lexical definition is: 
    </p>
      <pre>
      field_name ::=  (letter|"_") (letter | digit | "_")*
      letter     ::=  lowercase | uppercase
      lowercase  ::=  "a"..."z"
      uppercase  ::=  "A"..."Z"
      digit      ::=  "0"..."9"
      </pre>
    <p>
      The case of a field name is not significant such that URL and url are the same field name.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Fields are mandatory, optional, extensions or ignored.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As defined in this specification, a field can be mandatory, optional or ignored. Ignored fields are fields with a
      name that is not defined in this specification. Custom extensions are also supported and must be processed by
      tools as ignored fields unless you have built a custom tool to understand and process these extensions.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Field body
    </h3>
    <p>
      The body of a field and its encoding are defined according to the RFC5322 Email header specification Section 2.2
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-2.2">
        http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-2.2
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, a field body can contain multiple lines and space folding applies. In this example the description is one
      logical line:
    </p>
    <pre>
description: This is a long description for a
  software component that spans multiple lines with arbitrary line breaks.
     </pre>

    <h3>
      Referencing the file or folder documented by an ABOUT file.
    </h3>
    <p>
      An ABOUT file documents one file or folder. By convention, an ABOUT file is stored in the same folder as the file or folder it documents.
      An ABOUT file is named after the file or folder it documents adding a &quot;.ABOUT&quot; extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      a file named linux-3.7-rc7.tar.bz2.ABOUT provides documentation about the linux-3.7-rc7.tar.bz2 file
      stored in the same folder.
    </li>
    <li>
      a file named nodejs.ABOUT provides documentation about the nodejs folder stored side by side with the
      nodejs.ABOUT file.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Alternatively an ABOUT file may contain the &quot;about_file&quot; field that contains a POSIX path to the file it
      documents. This path is relative to the path of the ABOUT file.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, a file named django.ABOUT may contain the following field to provide documentation about the
      django-1.2.3.tar.gz file stored in the same folder:
    </p>
    <pre>
      about_file: django-1.2.3.tar.gz
    </pre>
    <p>
      The about_file field is optional and if present, it takes precedence over a file possibly pointed to by the ABOUT
      file name itself. This field can appear only once.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Fields validation
    </h3>
    <p>
      When a tool processes an ABOUT file it must produce a warning or error if a field is invalid. A field can be
      invalid for several reason such as an invalid syntax or an invalid content. Tools should report details on the
      nature of the error. The validation process should check that each field name and values are syntactically correct
      and contain correct values according to its (terse but common sense) definition in this specification. Certain
      fields may be used for additional specific validations (such as extensions for checksums verification, URL
      validity, path pointing to an existing text file, etc). Ignored fields should trigger a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field order does not matter with the following exception: multiple occurrences of a field name are possible and
      must be interpreted such that only the last occurrence is considered as the value for this field name. Previous
      occurrences must be treated as ignored fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tools processing an ABOUT file must issue a warning when a field name occurs more than once in an ABOUT file (as
      for any other ignored field).
    </p>

    <h3>
      Fields referencing files and URLs
    </h3>
    <p>
      The body of a field may be contained in another file. In this case the field name is suffixed with
      &quot;_file&quot; and the field body must be a POSIX path to the file that contains the body of the field. This
      path must be relative to the path of the ABOUT file.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance the full license text for a component is often stored in a separate file named COPYING:
    </p>
    <pre>
      license_text_file: COPYING
    </pre>
    <p>
      The body of a field may reference URLs such as a homepage or a download. In this case the field name is suffixed
      with &quot;_url&quot; and the field body must be a valid absolute URL. For instance the download URL is
      referenced this way:
    </p>
    <pre>
      download_url: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.4.20.tar.bz2
    </pre>

    <h3>
      Fields referencing files inside archives
    </h2>
    <p>
      To document files stored in an existing archive without needing to modify this archive, file-related fields can
      point to files stored inside an archive. (Suffixed fields with &quot;_file&quot;). The field body is a POSIX
      path to the archive file and the path to the file inside the archive. To address the file inside an archive, use
      the path as listed by the extracting tool commonly used to extract this archive type. This type of reference can
      be used for any &quot;_file&quot;-suffixed field, including the &quot;about_file&quot; field.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance compressed Tar archives are commonly extracted with GNU Tar and the archive file listing is obtained
      this way:
    </p>
    <pre>
      $ tar -tzf httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz
      httpd-2.4.3/
      httpd-2.4.3/CHANGES
      httpd-2.4.3/httpd.dsp
      httpd-2.4.3/LICENSE
      httpd-2.4.3/Makefile.in
      httpd-2.4.3/NOTICE
      httpd-2.4.3/README
      .....
    </pre>
    <p>
      Here the ABOUT file httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz.ABOUT could contain these fields to reference the existing LICENSE and
      NOTICE files provided in the archive:
    </p>
    <pre>
      license_text_file: httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz/httpd-2.4.3/LICENSE
      notice_file: httpd-2.4.3.tar.gz/httpd-2.4.3/NOTICE
    </pre>

    <h3>

    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Optional Extension fields
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can create extension fields by prefixing them with a short acronym to distinguish these from the standard
      fields. You should provide documentation for these extensions and create or extend existing tools to support
      these extensions. Other tools will ignore these extensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some basic extensions are provided here too.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Optional Extension fields to reference files stored in version control system
    </h3>
    <p>
      These fields provide a simple way to reference files stored in versions control system. There is a large number
      of version control tools such as CVS, Subversion, Git, ClearCase or GNU Arch and addressing accurately a file or
      folder revision in each of these tool in a uniform way is not an easy task. Some tool may require access control
      with user/password or certificates and typically this information should not be stored in the ABOUT files. The
      proposed approach is to define the &quot;scm_&quot; extension prefix and a few common fields to handle the
      diversity of SCM tools ways to reference files:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      scm_tool: SCM tool such as git, svn, cvs, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      scm_repository: Typically a URL or some other identifier used by the tool to point to a repository, folder
      or file, such as an SVN or Git repository URL.
    </li>
    <li>
      scm_path: Path to a file, folder or module used by certain SCM pointing inside a repository.
    </li>
    <li>
      scm_tag: tag name or path used by certain SCM.
    </li>
    <li>
      scm_branch: branch name or path used by certain SCM.
    </li>
    <li>
      scm_rev: revision identifier such as a revision hash or version number.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some examples:
    </p>
    <pre>
      scm_tool: svn
      scm_repository: http://svn.code.sf.net/p/inkscape/code/inkscape_project/trunk/inkscape_planet/
      scm_rev: 22886
    </pre>
    <p>
      or
    </p>
    <pre>
      scm_tool: git
      scm_repository: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
      scm_path: tools/lib/traceevent
      scm_rev: b59958d90b3e75a3b66cd311661535f94f5be4d1
    </pre>


    <h3>
      Optional Extension fields for checksums and digital signature
    </h3>
    <p>
      These fields support checksums (such as SHA1) and signatures (such as GPG) commonly provided with downloadable
      archives to verify their integrity. Tools could optionally use these to verify the integrity of a file documented
      by an ABOUT file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach is to define the &quot;checksum_&quot; and &quot;signature_&quot; extensions prefix padded with
      an identifier for each type of signature or checksum such as in &quot;scm_sha1&quot;.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      signature_&lt;tool id&gt;: Signature for the documented for the file documented by this ABOUT file. You
      may use signature_&lt;tool id&gt;_file to reference a pre-existing file as these signature files for GPG and PGP
      are commonly provided for verifying code archives such as here:
      <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.1.7.tar.sign">
        http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.1.7.tar.sign
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      checksum_sha1, checksum_md5, checksum_sha256: Checksum for the file documented by this ABOUT file. The
      suffix defines the checksum algorithm type such as &quot;_md5&quot;, &quot;_sha1&quot;, &quot;_sha256&quot;. The
      checksum algorithms and formats are as defined in the GNU Coreutils tools md5sum, sha1sum and sha256sum commands (
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">
        http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/
      </a>
      ) that follow the specifications defined in the FIPS-180-2 standard (
      <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf">
        http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf
      </a>
      ). Files can be referenced with the &quot;_file&quot; suffix such as with &quot;checksum_sha1_file&quot; to
      reference checksums files commonly provided such as here:
      <a href="http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/maven2/org/jdom/jdom/1.1.2/jdom-1.1.2-javadoc.jar.md5">
        http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/maven2/org/jdom/jdom/1.1.2/jdom-1.1.2-javadoc.jar.md5
