This is the specification for ABOUT files.


An ABOUT file provides a simple way to document the provenance 
(origin and license) and other important or interesting information 
about a software component. 


An ABOUT file is a small text file stored in the codebase side-by-side 
with the software component file or archive that it documents. 
No modification of the documented software is needed.
